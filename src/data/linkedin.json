To analyze the performance of the proposed clearing method, indices including profitability rates for power suppliers, participation rates of power suppliers and fair distribution of the revenue and net surpluses have been developed. Robustness and efficiency of the proposed clearing method are tested on the 24-bus IEEE RTS system, and the market problem is solved by a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition. The results evidence that the proposed clearing method improves the quality of reactive power compensation if compared with the available market clearing methods.",

      "summary": "Optimal allocation of measurement devices is a necessity in order to carry out state estimation of a distribution system. In this paper, the placement problem of power measurement devices is modeled using a multi‐objective method. The objectives of the problem are to minimize measurement devices' costs while increasing the accuracy of state estimation and improving the state estimation quality. Also, operational priorities are considered as another objective, which are based on power losses, lines' capacities, the number of lines connected to a specific line, and the change in lines' flows direction. A multi‐objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) is used to optimize the allocation of measurement devices within the problem of distribution system state estimation. The state estimation problem is optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and the Monte Carlo simulation is used to develop some conditions within the network to guarantee the robustness of the proposed method. The method is tested by simulation results on an IEEE 33‐bus and IEEE 123‐bus radial network.",

      "summary": "State estimation is essential to access observable network models for online monitoring and analyzing of power systems. Due to the integration of distributed energy resources and new technologies, state estimation in distribution systems would be necessary. However, accurate input data are essential for an accurate estimation along with knowledge on the possible correlation between the real and pseudo measurements data. This study presents a new approach to model errors for the distribution system state estimation purpose. In this paper, pseudo measurements are generated using a couple of real measurements data by means of the artificial neural network method. In the proposed method, the radial basis function network with the Gaussian kernel is also implemented to decompose pseudo measurements into several components. The robustness of the proposed error modeling method is assessed on IEEE 123-bus distribution test system where the problem is optimized by the imperialist competitive algorithm. The results evidence that the proposed method causes to increase in detachment accuracy of error components which results in presenting higher quality output in the distribution state estimation.",

Some new indices such as Units Association Rate, Producer Unit Profit Rate, Profit Distributing Rate, Production Sharing Rate and Risk of Work In Capacity Limits are introduced in this paper. These indices show the effectiveness of the proposed clearing strategy. The proposed algorithm is implemented on IEEE 24 bus test system.",

This prediction provides controlling the market competitive levels basis with preventive actions and preventive controls. Whist, the market power owners can be recognizable by analyzing different aspects of market power. This market power owners recognizing, simples the supervision of their non-competitive behaviors and allows operator to predict the type of probable collation between market power owners. In this paper, the dependency between the market power levels measurement indices is analysed by assessing the relation between set of market power competitive levels measurement indices values using decision tree. These values of market competitive levels are achieved by market simulation in 24-bus IEEE RTS. The market clearing is optimized by multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D).",

Quality of a power market clearing method could measure not only by the values of the market final costs but also by market participations rates, market profitability rates and fair distributing profits. In this paper, a new power market clearing method is presented to clear separate active and reactive power market which is founded on effectiveness of the market clearing strategy regarding to market input parameters changes. The Proposed clearing method aims at improving the control on more specific terms of market clearing including market total costs, market profitability, market competitive level, market share and dependency level of market clearing strategy to market input parameters. Robustness of the proposed market clearing method is tested on 24-bus IEEE RTS for separate reactive power market clearing and the market problem is solved by genetic algorithm. The results proof that the proposed clearing method improves the quality of market clearing performance if compared with other usual market clearing schemes.",
